# ZTF II-CLU Follow-up Web Application
This is a local Python browser application for tracking candidate sources in the Caltech ZTF Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment, a volume-luminosity limited supernova sample.
The code aggregates sources from the [Fritz marshal](https://fritz.science/) saved by a scanner to CLU. 
The web application presents plots and tables summarizing these sources and presenting the current classification completeness of the sample.

## About CLU
At present, the CLU experiment aims to save and classify all subluminous (peaking at magnitudes fainter than -17) supernovae within 150 Mpc (z<0.0331) that are less than 30 kpc (for z>0.01) and/or visibly associated with a CLU host galaxy.
CLU host galaxies are those in the [Cook et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab2131) CLU-compliled catalog of âˆ¼234,500 galaxies within 200 Mpc. 
Supernovae peaking brighter than -17 and/or outside the 150 Mpc volume (but still within 200 Mpc, the limits of the CLU galaxy catalog) are still saved to the Fritz group, but are not targets for spectroscopic follow-up.

## Running the Web Application
### Prerequisites
You must be a member of the Census of the Local Universe Caltech group on Fritz (group ID: 43) to use this web application as-is; the current CLU experiment parameters are hard-coded.
The versions of various Python packages used in the development of this web application are specified in `requirements.txt`.

### Getting Started
First, copy and paste your Fritz API access token as specified in `user_info.json`.

After navigating to the main directory, simply run the application from the terminal/command prompt with the following command:

`python sc.py -d [START DATE] -r [REFRESH DATE]`

Dates must be specified in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. By default, the start date is 2021-01-01 and there is no refresh date. 

In all use cases, new sources saved to CLU on Fritz will be appended to the most recent `.ascii` file in `query_data` (eg. `CLU_Query_2022_1_5.ascii`).
If a refresh date is specified, sources saved after that date are treated as "new" and updated data from Fritz will be downloaded accordingly.
Additionally, any query files older than two weeks are automatically deleted from the folder when `sc.py` is run.

If all goes well, a Flask-based webpage should automatically open in your browser on port 4000. If your computer localhost address is not the default 127.0.0.1, please edit line 113 in `sc.py` to the correct localhost address.

### Force Refresh Functionality
By not specifying a refresh date, previously downloaded data will not be updated, meaning that new classifications, photometry, and spectra will not be saved.
Therefore, it is generally recommended to always refresh one to two months prior to the current date you run the application, especially if there has been a recent observing run.

For example, on 2022-01-05, one might run the following:
`python sc.py -d 2021-01-01 -r 2021-12-01`

The refresh date also takes the string `all` as an argument. This will redownload the most current data starting from the specified start date, and it is recommended to use this function to fully update the data for any analysis using the query files.

## Further Notes
This web application was intitally developed by [Andy Tzanidakis](mailto:atzanida@uw.edu). 
[Tawny Sit](mailto:tsit@caltech.edu) is the current maintainer and has made significant edits to the underlying code (eg. optimizing the efficiency of Fritz API calls, creation of the completeness table, and fine-tuning of sample selection parameters). 

Currently working on fixing the "All Sources Saved By Month" dropdown menu to accomodate 2022. 
Direct links to individual months (eg. `http://127.0.0.1:4000/sources/2021/January`), or even a specific year (eg. `http://127.0.0.1:4000/sources/2021/` for all 2021 sources) are functional but cannot be accessed via the navbar yet.

Other feature suggestions and bug reports are welcome!
